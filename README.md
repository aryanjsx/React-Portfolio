# 👋 Hi, I'm Aryan Kumar! 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio, crafted with passion, creativity, and a love for technology!  
This project is a reflection of my journey as a developer, showcasing my skills, experiences, and the amazing tech I enjoy working with.

## 🛤️ My Journey

From writing my first lines of code to building full-stack applications, my path has been filled with curiosity and continuous learning.  
This portfolio is not just a website—it's my digital story, animated with the tools and frameworks I love.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

I built this portfolio using a modern, robust stack:

- ⚛️ **React.js** — The heart of the UI, making everything dynamic and interactive.
- 🎨 **CSS & Tailwind CSS** — For beautiful, responsive, and animated designs.
- 🌐 **Node.js & Express.js** — Powering backend logic (for future expansions!).
- 🗃️ **MySQL & Knex.js** — For data management and querying.
- ⚡ **Next.js** — For advanced React features and optimizations.
- 🖼️ **Font Awesome** — For crisp, animated icons.
- 🖌️ **Custom Animations** — Splash screens and transitions using React components and CSS animations.

> ✨ **Fun Fact:** The splash screen you see when you visit is animated using a custom React component!
